    <h1>7 Wonders of the World</h1>

      <h2>Great wall of China</h2>
      <img src="./images/w1.jpg" />
      <p>
        Great might be an understatement. One of the world’s largest
        building-construction projects, the Great Wall of China is widely
        thought to be about 5,500 miles (8,850 km) long; a disputed Chinese
        study, however, claims the length is 13,170 miles (21,200 km). Work
        began in the 7th century BCE and continued for two millennia. Although
        called a “wall,” the structure actually features two parallel walls for
        lengthy stretches. In addition, watchtowers and barracks dot the
        bulwark. One not-so-great thing about the wall, however, was its
        effectiveness Lorem ipsum dolor sit.

      <h2>Chichén Itzá</h2>
      <img src="./images/w2.jpg" />
      <p>
        Chichén Itzá is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, which
        flourished in the 9th and 10th centuries CE. Under the Mayan tribe
        Itzá—who were strongly influenced by the Toltecs—a number of important
        monuments and temples were built. Among the most notable is the stepped
        pyramid El Castillo (“The Castle”), which rises 79 feet (24 meters)
        above the Main Plaza. A testament to the Mayans astronomical abilities,
        the structure features a total of 365 steps, the number of days in the
        solar year. During the spring and autumnal equinoxes, the setting sun
        casts shadows.

      <h2>Petra</h2>
      <img src="./images/w3.jpg" />
      <p>
        The ancient city of Petra, Jordan, is located in a remote valley,
        nestled among sandstone mountains and cliffs. It was purported to be one
        of the places where Moses struck a rock and water gushed forth. Later
        the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, made it their capital, and during this
        time it flourished, becoming an important trade center, especially for
        spices. Noted carvers, the Nabataeans chiseled dwellings, temples, and
        tombs into the sandstone, which changed color with the shifting sun. In
        addition, they constructed a water system Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

        <h2>Machu Picchu</h2>
        <img src="./images/w4.jpg" />
        <p>
          This Incan site near Cuzco, Peru, was “discovered” in 1911 by Hiram
          Bingham, who believed it was Vilcabamba, a secret Incan stronghold
          used during the 16th-century rebellion against Spanish rule. Although
          that claim was later disproved, the purpose of Machu Picchu has
          confounded scholars. Bingham believed it was home to the “Virgins of
          the Sun,” women who lived in convents under a vow of chastity. Others
          think that it was likely a pilgrimage site, while some believe it was
          a royal retreat. One thing it apparently should not be is the site of
          a beer commercial.

        <h2>Christ the Redeemer</h2>
        <img src="./images/w5.jpg" />
        <p>
          Christ the Redeemer, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount
          Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro. Its origins date to just after World War
          I, when some Brazilians feared a “tide of godlessness.” They proposed
          a statue, which was ultimately designed by Heitor da Silva Costa,
          Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski. Construction began in 1926 and was
          completed five years later. The resulting monument stands 98 feet (30
          meters) tall—not including its base, which is about 26 feet (8 meters)
          high—and its outstretched arms span 92 feet (28 meters). It is the
          largest Art Deco sculpture in the world.

        <h2>Colosseum</h2>
        <img src="./images/w6.jpg" />
        <p>
          The Colosseum in Rome was built in the first century by order of the
          Emperor Vespasian. A feat of engineering, the amphitheater measures
          620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 meters) and features a complex system of
          vaults. It was capable of holding 50,000 spectators, who watched a
          variety of events. Perhaps most notable were gladiator fights, though
          men battling animals was also common. In addition, water was sometimes
          pumped into the Colosseum for mock naval engagements. However, the
          belief that Christians were martyred there—namely.

        <h2>Taj Mahal</h2>
        <img src="./images/w7.jpg" />
        <p>
          This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the
          world’s most iconic monuments and is perhaps the finest example of
          Mughal architecture. It was built by Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned
          1628–58) to honor his wife Mumtāz Maḥal (“Chosen One of the Palace”),
          who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child. It took about 22
          years and 20,000 workers to construct the complex, which includes an
          immense garden with a reflecting pool. The mausoleum is made of white
          marble that features semiprecious stones in geometric and floral
          patterns.
